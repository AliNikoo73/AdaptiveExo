# Personalized Exoskeleton Adaptation using Machine Learning and OpenSim

## Research Questions

1. How can machine learning algorithms optimize exoskeleton parameters for individual users based on their biomechanical data?
2. What features extracted from OpenSim simulations are most predictive of optimal exoskeleton assistance parameters?
3. How do different ML approaches compare in terms of prediction accuracy and computational efficiency for personalized exoskeleton tuning?
4. To what extent can transfer learning reduce the data collection burden for new users while maintaining adaptation performance?

## Project Overview

This repository contains a framework for developing personalized exoskeleton control parameters using machine learning models trained on biomechanical simulation data. The project integrates OpenSim musculoskeletal modeling with machine learning pipelines to predict optimal assistance parameters based on individual user characteristics.

## Methodology

Our approach follows these key steps:

1. **Data Collection and Processing**: Collect or simulate biomechanical data from users with varying anthropometric characteristics
2. **OpenSim Simulation**: Process biomechanical data through OpenSim to extract relevant features and simulate exoskeleton assistance
3. **Feature Engineering**: Extract meaningful biomechanical features from simulation outputs
4. **Machine Learning**: Train models to predict optimal exoskeleton parameters based on user-specific features
5. **Validation**: Validate predictions against simulated performance metrics and iteratively refine models
6. **Visualization**: Generate interpretable visualizations of model predictions and biomechanical outcomes
